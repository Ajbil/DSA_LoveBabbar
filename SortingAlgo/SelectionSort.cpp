/*Selection sort is one of the sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning of the unsorted region of the array.*/

/* time complexity o(n^2) as we run 2 for loop in this code (for both best and worst case)  
space complexity o(1) as many koi extra space nahi li bas variables banaye hai aur vo spcace nahi khate

use case:- jab array ya vector ka size chota ho tab ek baar selection sort ke baare mai soch lena


IN INTERVIEW QUESTION CAN BE ASKED WHAT IS DIFFENRCE BETWEEN A STABLE AND A UNSTABLE SORTING 
ALGORITHM? AND IS SELECTION SORT A STABLE OR UNSTBALE SORTING ALGO?
