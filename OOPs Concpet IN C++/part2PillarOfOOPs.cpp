//4 Pillars of OOPs Concept -Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation & Abstraction

//encapsulation
/*
--> all memebers of a class are marked private in a fully encapsulated class
--> data hiding / information hiding achieved as we make members private 
-- > we can make the class read only by using getters
--> code reusability

// inheritance 

15:00 see implememntation in video
22:00 access modifiers imp role in inheritance explained
27:50 private data member of any parent class can not be inherited to its child class

//must see those 9 cases i.e cobination of case when the parent class is public, private and protected and its child class is public, private and protected
there are 9 cases and these are asked in interview in oops 


// TYPES OF INHERITANCES 
-> single, multiple ,multi level, heirarchical (here one imp error shown which came at 57:00 minutes),and hybrid inheritances 


// inheritnace ambiguity -- > use of scope resolution operator 

// polymorppjism -> v imp ->2 types compile time and run time polymorphism 

1) compilw time also called static polymorphism ->function over loading(same naam se 2 function hum declare kar sakte agar unke signature mai hum thode changes kar de toh)
and operator overloading -> 1:15:00

2) run time polymorphism  also called dynamic polymorphism -> function or method overriding (basically same funtion but diffenrt implememntation in parent and child class)


//abstraction -- > hidinh the implemmentatoion and only useful detials are shown
