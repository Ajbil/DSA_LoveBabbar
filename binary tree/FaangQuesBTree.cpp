1 Height of Binary Tree -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/height-of-binary-tree/1
 TIP -> AGAR samjh na aaye atoh rucursion vale ques mai recursive tree banake dekha karo 

2 Diameter of a Binary Tree -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1
// very nice ques  - > heerer we used something called PAIR CONCEPT 

3)Check for Balanced Tree -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-balanced-tree/1
can be asked directly in interview 
// this ques also resemble to ques 2 aas here also for optimised code i used pair 

4 Determine if Two Trees are Identical-> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/determine-if-two-trees-are-identical/1
//recursion jndabaad baut use aata tree mai 

5 Sum Tree ->  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-tree/1
VERY NICE QUESTION  using pair this also i solved

//Lecture 65: Binary Tree FAANG Interview Questions || Part-3

In this Video, we are going to solve 7 TREE Interview Questions.


1)Sum of the Longest Bloodline of a Tree (Sum of nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node)-> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-the-longest-bloodline-of-a-tree/1

2Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0hE0R_ng4&list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA&index=71&ab_channel=CodeHelp-byBabbar

//DOUBT HAI ISME AACHE SE SAMJH NI AAYA YEAH QUES   

5 Maximum sum of Non-adjacent nodes->https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sum-of-non-adjacent-nodes/1




//Lecture 66: Construct a Binary Tree from InOrder/PreOrder/PostOrder Traversal

imp qustion 

1)  Construct Tree from Inorder & Preorder -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/construct-tree-1/1

2 Tree from Postorder and Inorder -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/tree-from-postorder-and-inorder/1


//Lecture 67: Minimum Time to BURN the Entire Binary Tree || C++ Placement Series
link -> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/burning-tree/1
//imp asked many times in interview 

Lecture 68: Morris Traversal || Flatten a Binary tree to Linked List || C++ Placement Series
//came in google interview last year 

TILL NOW IN ALL TRAVERSAL METHODS WE SAW INORDER LEVELORDER ETC ALL USED O(N) TIME AND SPACE COMPELXITY BUT MORRIS USES CONSTANT SPACE 
// in sabhi traversal mai hum recursuion ki help se uppar bhi aa skate hain but agagr mujhe iterative way mai karna ho traverse toh wapis uppar aane ka koi tarika nahi hai 
yoh morris mai hum temorary links banate hai isi ke liye 
//morris ka answer toh preorder,inorder etc,traversal vala hi hoga bas algo alag hogi thodi i.e print sttament allag alag jagah lagega
//asme hao ek node ko hum at most 3 baar viist karnege ek baar print ke lliye ek baar temprorary link banane ke liye aur ek baar hatane ke liiye
